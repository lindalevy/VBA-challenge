Week 2 homework - VBA-Challenge Completed.

Submission includes:
      VBA Code save as Visual Basic in Visual Studio
      Screen of of each years outcome: 2014, 2015, 2016

In addition to these, as part of completing the homework there are two excel spreadsheets:
      Alphabetical testing (a smaller workbook used to finesse the code)
      Multiple_year-stock-data (a much larger workbook, where the final code was copied to and run.)
      These two spreadsheets are not submitted as part of the homework as they were too large for GitHub
