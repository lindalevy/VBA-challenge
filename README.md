# VBA-challenge

Week 2 homework - VBA-Challenge Completed I believe.

Submission includes:
      VBA Code save as Visual Basic in Visual Studio
      Screen of of each years outcome: 2014, 2015, 2016

In addition to these, as part of completing the homework there are two excel spreadsheets:
      Alphabetical testing (a smaller workbook used to finesse the code)
      Multiple_year-stock-data (a much larger workbook, where the final code was copied to and run.)
      These two spreadsheets are not submitted as part of the homework as they were too large for GitHub

The code may be a bit clunky, and I looked at alternatives, but didnt really understand that they would necessarily make the code run faster or result in less lines of code.

I compared my outcomes to the screen shot incorporated in homework excercise README file. The yearly change and the % change both show different results, where as the olumn total is the same. I created test samples and verified that I am as confidient as I can be that the code is running correctly. So will be fascinated to see what I have missed if it is wrong.
